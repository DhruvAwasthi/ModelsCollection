# Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)  

**Overview:**  
- This will develop skills in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, the process of assigning a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective...) to each word in an input text.  Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. They are  **Ambiguous**.  
- Distinguishing the parts-of-speech of a word in a sentence will help you better understand the meaning of a sentence. This would be critically important in search queries. Identifying the proper noun, the organization, the stock symbol, or anything similar would greatly improve everything ranging from speech recognition to search.  
- You will implement the Viterbi algorithm which makes use of dynamic programming.  
- This will use two tagged data sets collected from the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ)**.

**Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!**
