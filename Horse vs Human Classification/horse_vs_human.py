# The following python code will use the OS library to use Operating System libraries, giving you access to the file system, and the zipfile library allowing you to unzip the data. 

# In[3]:


import os
import zipfile

local_zip = '/tmp/horse-or-human.zip'
zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/horse-or-human')
local_zip = '/tmp/validation-horse-or-human.zip'

zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/validation-horse-or-human')
zip_ref.close()


# The contents of the .zip are extracted to the base directory `/tmp/horse-or-human`, which in turn each contain `horses` and `humans` subdirectories.
# 
# In short: The training set is the data that is used to tell the neural network model that 'this is what a horse looks like', 'this is what a human looks like' etc. 
# 
# Let's define directories:

# In[4]:


# Directory with our training horse pictures
train_horse_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/horse-or-human/horses')

# Directory with our training human pictures
train_human_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/horse-or-human/humans')

# Directory with our training horse pictures
validation_horse_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/validation-horse-or-human/horses')

# Directory with our training human pictures
validation_human_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/validation-horse-or-human/humans')


# Now, let's see what the filenames look like in the `horses` and `humans` training directories:

# In[5]:


train_horse_names = os.listdir(train_horse_dir)
print(train_horse_names[:10])

train_human_names = os.listdir(train_human_dir)
print(train_human_names[:10])

validation_horse_hames = os.listdir(validation_horse_dir)
print(validation_horse_hames[:10])

validation_human_names = os.listdir(validation_human_dir)
print(validation_human_names[:10])


# Let's find out the total number of horse and human images in the directories:

# In[6]:


print('total training horse images:', len(os.listdir(train_horse_dir)))
print('total training human images:', len(os.listdir(train_human_dir)))
print('total validation horse images:', len(os.listdir(validation_horse_dir)))
print('total validation human images:', len(os.listdir(validation_human_dir)))


# Now let's take a look at a few pictures to get a better sense of what they look like. First, configure the matplot parameters:

# In[7]:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

# Parameters for our graph; we'll output images in a 4x4 configuration
nrows = 4
ncols = 4

# Index for iterating over images
pic_index = 0


# Now, display a batch of 8 horse and 8 human pictures. We can rerun the cell to see a fresh batch each time:

# In[8]:


# Set up matplotlib fig, and size it to fit 4x4 pics
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.set_size_inches(ncols * 4, nrows * 4)

pic_index += 8
next_horse_pix = [os.path.join(train_horse_dir, fname)

                for fname in train_human_names[pic_index-8:pic_index]]

for i, img_path in enumerate(next_horse_pix+next_human_pix):
  # Set up subplot; subplot indices start at 1
  sp = plt.subplot(nrows, ncols, i + 1)

# ## Building a Small Model from Scratch

# In[10]:


import tensorflow as tf


# We then add convolutional layers as in the previous example, and flatten the final result to feed into the densely connected layers.

# Note that because we are facing a two-class classification problem, i.e. a *binary classification problem*, we will end our network with a [*sigmoid* activation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), so that the output of our network will be a single scalar between 0 and 1, encoding the probability that the current image is class 1 (as opposed to class 0).

# In[11]:


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # Note the input shape is the desired size of the image 300x300 with 3 bytes color
    # This is the first convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(300, 300, 3)),

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer=RMSprop(lr=0.001),
              metrics=['accuracy'])


# ### Data Preprocessing
# 
# Let's set up data generators that will read pictures in our source folders, convert them to `float32` tensors, and feed them (with their labels) to our network. We'll have one generator for the training images and one for the validation images. Our generators will yield batches of images of size 300x300 and their labels (binary).

# In[14]:


from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# All images will be rescaled by 1./255
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)
validation_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        '/tmp/horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(300, 300),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=128,
        # Since we use binary_crossentropy loss, we need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
validation_generator = validation_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        '/tmp/validation-horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(300, 300),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=32,
        # Since we use binary_crossentropy loss, we need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')


# ### Training
# Let's train for 15 epochs.
# The Loss and Accuracy are a great indication of progress of training. It's making a guess as to the classification of the training data, and then measuring it against the known label, calculating the result. Accuracy is the portion of correct guesses. 

# In[15]:


history = model.fit(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=8,  
      epochs=15,
      verbose=1,
      validation_data = validation_generator,
      validation_steps=8)


# ### Running the Model
# 
# Let's now take a look at actually running a prediction using the model. This code will allow you to choose 1 or more files from your file system, it will then upload them, and run them through the model, giving an indication of whether the object is a horse or a human.

# In[ ]:


import numpy as np
from google.colab import files
from keras.preprocessing import image

uploaded = files.upload()

for fn in uploaded.keys():
 
  # predicting images
  path = '/content/' + fn
  img = image.load_img(path, target_size=(300, 300))
  x = image.img_to_array(img)
  x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

  images = np.vstack([x])
  classes = model.predict(images, batch_size=10)
  print(classes[0])
  if classes[0]>0.5:
    print(fn + " is a human")
  else:
    print(fn + " is a horse")
 


# ### Visualizing Intermediate Representations
# 
# To get a feel for what kind of features our convnet has learned, one fun thing to do is to visualize how an input gets transformed as it goes through the convnet.
# 
# Let's pick a random image from the training set, and then generate a figure where each row is the output of a layer, and each image in the row is a specific filter in that output feature map. Rerun this cell to generate intermediate representations for a variety of training images.

# In[16]:


import numpy as np
import random
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array, load_img

# Let's define a new Model that will take an image as input, and will output
# intermediate representations for all layers in the previous model after
# the first.
successive_outputs = [layer.output for layer in model.layers[1:]]
#visualization_model = Model(img_input, successive_outputs)
visualization_model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs = model.input, outputs = successive_outputs)
# Let's prepare a random input image from the training set.
horse_img_files = [os.path.join(train_horse_dir, f) for f in train_horse_names]
human_img_files = [os.path.join(train_human_dir, f) for f in train_human_names]
img_path = random.choice(horse_img_files + human_img_files)

img = load_img(img_path, target_size=(300, 300))  # this is a PIL image
x = img_to_array(img)  # Numpy array with shape (150, 150, 3)
x = x.reshape((1,) + x.shape)  # Numpy array with shape (1, 150, 150, 3)

# Rescale by 1/255
x /= 255

# Let's run our image through our network, thus obtaining all
# intermediate representations for this image.
successive_feature_maps = visualization_model.predict(x)

# These are the names of the layers, so can have them as part of our plot
layer_names = [layer.name for layer in model.layers]

# Now let's display our representations
for layer_name, feature_map in zip(layer_names, successive_feature_maps):
  if len(feature_map.shape) == 4:
    # Just do this for the conv / maxpool layers, not the fully-connected layers
    n_features = feature_map.shape[-1]  # number of features in feature map
    # The feature map has shape (1, size, size, n_features)
    size = feature_map.shape[1]
    # We will tile our images in this matrix
    display_grid = np.zeros((size, size * n_features))
    for i in range(n_features):
      # Postprocess the feature to make it visually palatable
      x = feature_map[0, :, :, i]
      x -= x.mean()
      x /= x.std()
      x *= 64
      x += 128
      x = np.clip(x, 0, 255).astype('uint8')
      # We'll tile each filter into this big horizontal grid
      display_grid[:, i * size : (i + 1) * size] = x
    # Display the grid
    scale = 20. / n_features
    plt.figure(figsize=(scale * n_features, scale))
    plt.title(layer_name)
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(display_grid, aspect='auto', cmap='viridis')


# As you can see we go from the raw pixels of the images to increasingly abstract and compact representations. The representations downstream start highlighting what the network pays attention to, and they show fewer and fewer features being "activated"; most are set to zero. This is called "sparsity." Representation sparsity is a key feature of deep learning.
# 
# 
# These representations carry increasingly less information about the original pixels of the image, but increasingly refined information about the class of the image. You can think of a convnet (or a deep network in general) as an information distillation pipeline.
