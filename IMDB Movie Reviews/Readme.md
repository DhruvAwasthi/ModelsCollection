# IMDB Movie Reviews
## Best case accuracy: 97.91% Train Accuracy and 86.43% Validation Accuracy

In this model, we will predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative.

**Understanding the dataset:**
IMBD reviews is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. It provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well.

We will do this by three ways:
- Using `subwords 8K with 1D Conv layer` (98.93% train accuracy and 85.48 validation accuracy)
- Using `subwords 8K with multi-layer LSTM` (97.91% train accuracy and 86.43% validation accuracy)
- Using `Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)` (100% train accuracy and 81.29% validation accuracy).
