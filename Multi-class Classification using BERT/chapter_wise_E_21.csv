This chapter provides details on the special port usage.,Special Port Usage
"The information contained in this chapter has been prepared based on the specifications of the standard equipment. Throughout the manual, figures provided in this manual, including operation screens and appearances, may vary from the equipment installed at your site.",Special Port Usage
Special Port Usage,Special Port Usage
Introduction,Special Port Usage
Overview:,Special Port Usage
"Be sure to set the carrier, that stores the wafers which are used for the processes other than the production lot process such as dummy process or cleaning, to the special port. Also, set the usage of the wafer in the dummy storage.",Special Port Usage
"The wafers in the carrier and the dummy storage, that are not set to the special port, cannot be used for other than product lot process.",Special Port Usage
Dummy Port and Test Port,Special Port Usage
"There are two types of special ports; dummy port and test port. When setting the dummy storage to the special port, it should be used only as a dummy port.",Special Port Usage
Prepare different carriers since the usage of the dummy port and the test port differs.,Special Port Usage
"The wafers in the dummy port are used for the following usage. Set the usage and the process module, in which the wafer will be used, for each wafer.",Special Port Usage
• Lot-stabilization dummy (used for lot-stabilization dummy process) • Cleaning (used for lot cleaning process/out-lot cleaning process/cleaning process depending on PM usage times) • Seasoning (used when seasoning is executed at the cleaning process depending on PM usage times) • Combined application of lot-stabilization dummy and cleaning (Used for the lot-stabiliza-tion dummy process described above and each process performed for cleaning),Special Port Usage
"The wafers in the test port are used for the following auto setup function usage. Set the usage and the process module, in which the wafer will be used, for each wafer.",Special Port Usage
• Seasoning • Particle Check • Measuring Etch Rate • Test Transfer • Collecting Wafer (set to an empty slot),Special Port Usage
Maintaining and Managing Wafers in Special Port,Special Port Usage
Maintenance timing for the wafers in the special port can be set (see page 124) . The maintenance timing for the wafer is set to each slot of the special port.,Special Port Usage
Canceling Special Port Setting,Special Port Usage
The special port setting is canceled in the following cases:,Special Port Usage
• Unload the carrier which is set to the special port.,Special Port Usage
• Press  Cancel  for the relevant special port on the  Special Port Setup  screen (refer to 3.2 Operating the Special Port Setup Screen (see page 77) ).,Special Port Usage
The setting information will be cleared as the special port setting is canceled.,Special Port Usage
"If the wafer maintenance timing is set on the slot of the special port, the total values of all the slots will be reset (see page 124) . Note that the maintenance timing setting details are maintained.",Special Port Usage
Saving Setting Information File,Special Port Usage
The setting information for the special port can be saved as a data file. The number of files that can be saved for the dummy port and test port is maximum ten files each.,Special Port Usage
The saved files can be exported/imported between the equipment ←→ removable media.,Special Port Usage

"Gas 0 Point Flow Rate The gas 0 point flow rate check is conducted by measuring the gas flow rate with a flow meter in a no-gas-flow condition, and then by comparing the finding with the set value of  PM# Parameter  ( Maintenance / Auto Check )  Gas n Permit Range of 0 Point Flow Rate  to evaluate whether the flow meter reading is within the normal range.",Executing Auto Check
"Gas Adjust 0 Point The gas 0 point adjustment is the function to adjust the 0 point of the flow meter in the no-gas-flow conditions, closing the primary and secondary valves on the flow meter.",Executing Auto Check
"Gas Flow Rate/Stability The gas flow rate is checked by feeding gas at a predetermined flow rate into the process module under vacuum and calculating the flow rate from the resultant pressure increase inclination, and comparing the error rate relative to the preset flow rate (theoretical value) with the  Gas n Permit Range of Gas Flow Rate Error  of  PM# Parameter  ( Maintenance / Auto Check ) or the initial value to evaluate whether the error rate is within the normal range.",Executing Auto Check
"The stability is checked by feeding gas at a predetermined flow rate into the process module under vacuum, calculating the residual difference between the measured pressure and the calculated pressure increase curve linearity, and then comparing the difference with the  Gas n Permit Range of Stability Press.  of  PM# Parameter  ( Maintenance / Auto Check ) or the initial value to evaluate whether it is within the normal range.",Executing Auto Check
The MFC flow rate check and stability check are conducted simultaneously.,Executing Auto Check
"PCV 0 Point The PCV 0 point pressure is checked by measuring the pressure inside the process module after exhausting the process module for a predetermined time, and then comparing the measurement with the set value of  PM# Parameter  ( Maintenance / Auto Check ) (the set value of  PCV Permit Range of 0 Point Press (center)  for the PCV (center) check, or the set value of  PCV Permit Range of 0 Point Press (edge)  for the PCV (edge) check) to evaluate whether the reading on the capacitance manometer is within the normal range.",Executing Auto Check

Introduction,Auto Setup Execution
Overview:,Auto Setup Execution
The auto-setup function executes changing of the operation from the maintenance mode to normal mode automatically.,Auto Setup Execution
The contents of the check at the auto-setup can be set on the auto setup macro. The check contents set for the auto setup macro can be executed when the relevant module changes from the maintenance mode to the normal mode (non-production). The followings can be set in the auto setup macro.,Auto Setup Execution
"• Check Content: Choose which check is to be performed out of processing, such as the capacitance manometer, flow meter, and leak check. • Check Order: Specify in what order it checks. Moreover, as a result of checking, when abnormalities are detected, specification that a special check is performed can also be carried out. • Detailed Setting with Parameter: By having a macro parameter for every auto setup macro, it can check on various conditions according to the recovery situation.",Auto Setup Execution
"For information about creating/editing auto setup macros, refer to  Operating the Maintenance Macro Editor Screen  in the  Advanced Operations Maintenance Macro Manual .",Auto Setup Execution
"Also, the QC check function which can be executed from the normal mode is provided to the auto-setup. When the QC check is executed, changing from the normal mode to maintenance mode, and then to the normal mode, are executed automatically to execute the check contents which is set to the auto setup macro while changing to the normal mode.",Auto Setup Execution
The auto-setup is intended to optimize the process and save labor by automating the operation of changing to the normal mode after the maintenance tasks. The QC check is intended to transfer the non-production wafers used for measuring particle of the process module or the etch rate in the intervals between lot process.,Auto Setup Execution
