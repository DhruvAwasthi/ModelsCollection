# Models Hub - Home to various Deep Learning & Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the jupyter notebook and raw python code for building and implementing various deep learning and machine learning models. I built all these models while I was practicing them. Thought these might help somebody to get through the code.

I would like to present my heartful thanks to **Andrew Ng (Co-Founder, Coursera), Aurelien Geron (Author of book 'HandOn ML with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow') and Laurence Moroney (Developer Advocate at Google).** It is because of you all (and yea, a lil bit of efforts from my side xD) that I am able to do this. Without you it could have not been possible. Thank you so much for teaching a thousand and even million more learners like me.

**If you have any doubt, feel free to ask me.**
