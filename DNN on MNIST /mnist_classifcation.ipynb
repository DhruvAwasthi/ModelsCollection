In TensorFlow, the optimizer's minimize() function takes care of both computing the gradients and applying them, so you must instead call the optimizer's **compute_gradients()** methods first, then create an operation to clip the gradients using the **clip_by_value()** function, and finally create an operation to apply the clipped gradients using the optimizer's **apply_gradients()** method:"

    "    - if the fit() method is given a validation set (X_valid and y_valid), then it implements early stopping. This implementation does not save the best model to disk, but rather to memory: it uses the _get_model_params() method to get all the graph's variables and their values, and the _restore_model_params() method to restore the variable values (of the best model found). This trick helps speed up training.\n",
