# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using Deep Neural Networks
## Best case Accuracy: 99.39% using my own DNN Classifier class.

#### Summary:
- Used `name_scope` to define clear computational graphs
- Used various techniques to best fit the model such as `Batch Normalization`, `Gradient Clipping`, `Freezing and Caching lower layers for faster results`, `Learning Rate Scheduling`, `L1 and L2 Regularization`, `Dropout`, `Max-Norm Regularization`, `Cross-Validation`, `RandomizedSearchCV`
- Used differnet optimizers such as `GradientDescent` and `AdamOptimizer`
- Was able to save and and then restore the pretrained model, and further training it.
- Reused models trained from other frameworks other than TensorFlow as well with >90% accuracy.
- Tried `Transfer Learning` in later part to explore more about it and it yields 90.24% accuray with good hyperparameter tuning.
