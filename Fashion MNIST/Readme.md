# Fashion MNIST using single Convolutional Layer
## Best case Accuracy: 99.8% Train Accuracy and 98.61% Test Accuracy
**Understanding the dataset:**
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

#### Summary:
- Used `callbacks` for stopping training when accuracy achieved 99.8%
- Used just single `convolutional layer`, a `max pooling layer`, `flatten` the outputs and then two `dense layers`
- Used `AdamOptimizer` for model optimization
- Used `sparse_categorical_croosentropy` for calculating the loss.
