# ## 0 - Naive Face Verification
# 
# In Face Verification, you're given two images and you have to determine if they are of the same person. The simplest way to do this is to compare the two images pixel-by-pixel. If the distance between the raw images are less than a chosen threshold, it may be the same person! 

# * Of course, this algorithm performs really poorly, since the pixel values change dramatically due to variations in lighting, orientation of the person's face, even minor changes in head position, and so on. 
# * You'll see that rather than using the raw image, you can learn an encoding, $f(img)$.  
# * By using an encoding for each image, an element-wise comparison produces a more accurate judgement as to whether two pictures are of the same person.

# ## 1 - Encoding face images into a 128-dimensional vector 
# 
# ### 1.1 - Using a ConvNet  to compute encodings
# 
# The FaceNet model takes a lot of data and a long time to train. So following common practice in applied deep learning, let's  load weights that someone else has already trained. The network architecture follows the Inception model from [Szegedy *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842). We have provided an inception network implementation. You can look in the file `inception_blocks_v2.py` to see how it is implemented.

# The key things to know are:
# 
# - This network uses 96x96 dimensional RGB images as its input. Specifically, inputs a face image (or batch of $m$ face images) as a tensor of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W) = (m, 3, 96, 96)$ 
# - It outputs a matrix of shape $(m, 128)$ that encodes each input face image into a 128-dimensional vector
# 
# Run the cell below to create the model for face images.

# In[17]:


FRmodel = faceRecoModel(input_shape=(3, 96, 96))


# In[18]:


print("Total Params:", FRmodel.count_params())


# By using a 128-neuron fully connected layer as its last layer, the model ensures that the output is an encoding vector of size 128. We can then use the encodings to compare two face images as follows:
# 
# By computing the distance between two encodings and thresholding, you can determine if the two pictures represent the same person.
# 
# So, an encoding is a good one if: 
# - The encodings of two images of the same person are quite similar to each other. 
# - The encodings of two images of different persons are very different.
# 
# The triplet loss function formalizes this, and tries to "push" the encodings of two images of the same person (Anchor and Positive) closer together, while "pulling" the encodings of two images of different persons (Anchor, Negative) further apart. 

# 
# ### 1.2 - The Triplet Loss
# 
# For an image $x$, we denote its encoding $f(x)$, where $f$ is the function computed by the neural network.
# 
# Training will use triplets of images $(A, P, N)$:  
# 
# - A is an "Anchor" image--a picture of a person. 
# - P is a "Positive" image--a picture of the same person as the Anchor image.
# - N is a "Negative" image--a picture of a different person than the Anchor image.
# 
# These triplets are picked from our training dataset. We will write $(A^{(i)}, P^{(i)}, N^{(i)})$ to denote the $i$-th training example. 
# 
# We'd like to make sure that an image $A^{(i)}$ of an individual is closer to the Positive $P^{(i)}$ than to the Negative image $N^{(i)}$) by at least a margin $\alpha$:
# 
# $$\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2 + \alpha < \mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2$$
# 
# We would thus like to minimize the following "triplet cost":
# 
# $$\mathcal{J} = \sum^{m}_{i=1} \large[ \small \underbrace{\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2}_\text{(1)} - \underbrace{\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2}_\text{(2)} + \alpha \large ] \small_+Â \tag{3}$$
# 
# Here, we are using the notation "$[z]_+$" to denote $max(z,0)$.  
# 
# Notes:
# - The term (1) is the squared distance between the anchor "A" and the positive "P" for a given triplet; you want this to be small. 
# - The term (2) is the squared distance between the anchor "A" and the negative "N" for a given triplet, you want this to be relatively large. It has a minus sign preceding it because minimizing the negative of the term is the same as maximizing that term.
# - $\alpha$ is called the margin. It is a hyperparameter that you pick manually. We will use $\alpha = 0.2$. 
# 
# Most implementations also rescale the encoding vectors to haven L2 norm equal to one (i.e., $\mid \mid f(img)\mid \mid_2$=1); you won't have to worry about that in this assignment.
#

# Let's now use this model to perform face verification and face recognition! 

# ## 3 - Applying the model

# We are building a system for an office building where the building manager would like to offer facial recognition to allow the employees to enter the building.
# 
# We'd like to build a **Face verification** system that gives access to the list of people who live or work there. To get admitted, each person has to swipe an ID card (identification card) to identify themselves at the entrance. The face recognition system then checks that they are who they claim to be.

# ### 3.1 - Face Verification
# 
# Let's build a database containing one encoding vector for each person who is allowed to enter the office. To generate the encoding we use `img_to_encoding(image_path, model)`, which runs the forward propagation of the model on the specified image. 
# 
# The following code builds the database (represented as a python dictionary). This database maps each person's name to a 128-dimensional encoding of their face.

# In[69]:


database = {}
database["danielle"] = img_to_encoding("images/danielle.png", FRmodel)
database["younes"] = img_to_encoding("images/younes.jpg", FRmodel)
database["tian"] = img_to_encoding("images/tian.jpg", FRmodel)
database["andrew"] = img_to_encoding("images/andrew.jpg", FRmodel)
database["kian"] = img_to_encoding("images/kian.jpg", FRmodel)

database["bertrand"] = img_to_encoding("images/bertrand.jpg", FRmodel)
database["kevin"] = img_to_encoding("images/kevin.jpg", FRmodel)
database["felix"] = img_to_encoding("images/felix.jpg", FRmodel)
database["benoit"] = img_to_encoding("images/benoit.jpg", FRmodel)
database["arnaud"] = img_to_encoding("images/arnaud.jpg", FRmodel)


# Now, when someone shows up at your front door and swipes their ID card (thus giving you their name), you can look up their encoding in the database, and use it to check if the person standing at the front door matches the name on the ID.
# 
# Let's implement the `verify()` function which checks if the front-door camera picture (`image_path`) is actually the person called "identity". We will have to go through the following steps:
# 1. Compute the encoding of the image from `image_path`.
# 2. Compute the distance between this encoding and the encoding of the identity image stored in the database.
# 3. Open the door if the distance is less than 0.7, else do not open it.

# In[74]:


verify("images/camera_2.jpg", "kian", database, FRmodel)


# ### 3.2 - Face Recognition
# 
# Our face verification system is mostly working well. But since Kian got his ID card stolen, when he came back to the office the next day and couldn't get in! 
# 
# To solve this, we'd like to change our face verification system to a face recognition system. This way, no one has to carry an ID card anymore. An authorized person can just walk up to the building, and the door will unlock for them! 
# 
# We'll implement a face recognition system that takes as input an image, and figures out if it is one of the authorized persons (and if so, who). Unlike the previous face verification system, we will no longer get a person's name as one of the inputs. 
# 
# Let's implement `who_is_it()`. We will have to go through the following steps:
# 1. Compute the target encoding of the image from image_path
# 2. Find the encoding from the database that has smallest distance with the target encoding. 
#     - Initialize the `min_dist` variable to a large enough number (100). It will help you keep track of what is the closest encoding to the input's encoding.
#     - Loop over the database dictionary's names and encodings. To loop use `for (name, db_enc) in database.items()`.
#         - Compute the L2 distance between the target "encoding" and the current "encoding" from the database.
#         - If this distance is less than the min_dist, then set `min_dist` to `dist`, and `identity` to `name`.

# #### Congratulations!
# 
# * Our face recognition system is working well! It only lets in authorized persons, and people don't need to carry an ID card around anymore! 
# * We've now seen how a state-of-the-art face recognition system works.
# 
# #### Ways to improve our facial recognition model
# Although we won't implement it here, here are some ways to further improve the algorithm:
# - Put more images of each person (under different lighting conditions, taken on different days, etc.) into the database. Then given a new image, compare the new face to multiple pictures of the person. This would increase accuracy.
# - Crop the images to just contain the face, and less of the "border" region around the face. This preprocessing removes some of the irrelevant pixels around the face, and also makes the algorithm more robust.

# ## Key points to remember
# - Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem; face recognition addresses a harder 1:K matching problem. 
# - The triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network to learn an encoding of a face image.
# - The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition. Measuring distances between two images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are pictures of the same person.
