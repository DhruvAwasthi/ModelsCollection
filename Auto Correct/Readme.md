# Auto Correct
In this part, you will implement an auto-correct system that is very effective and useful.

**Overview:**  
- You use autocorrect every day on your cell phone and computer. In this, you will explore what really goes on behind the scenes. Of course, the model you are about to implement is not identical to the one used in your phone, but it is still quite good.  
- You will use the minimum edit distance and implement implement a dynamic programming system that will tell you the minimum number of edits required to convert a string into another string.  


**Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!**
