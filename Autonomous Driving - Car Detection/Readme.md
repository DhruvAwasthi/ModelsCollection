# Autonomous Driving - Car Detection

**In this model, we are outputting the detected cars in an image together with the bounding boxes which can be used for autonomous driving.**

`You Only Look Once (YOLO)` is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes

#### Summary:
- Implementing object detection using the very powerful YOLO (You Look Only Once) model
- Used object detection on a car detection dataset
- Dealt with bounding boxes

##### Suggestions are always welcome!
##### Thank you and keep supporting!
