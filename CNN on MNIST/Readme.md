# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Best case Accuracy: 99.27%, using conv2d, max pooling, and dropout layers.

#### Summary:
- Used `name_scope` to define clear computational graphs
- Used various techniques to best fit the model such as `max pooling layers`, `fully connected layers`, `dropout layers`, and `early stopping`
- Used differnet optimizers such as `GradientDescent` and `AdamOptimizer`
- Saved and restored models


# Classifying large images using Inception Network

#### Summary:
- Downloading and loading raw data on the fly using `urllib` and `pandas`
- Used `image augmentation` to get better results
- Saving and restoring from `checkpoints`.


##### Suggestions are always welcome!
