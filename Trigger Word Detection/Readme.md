# Trigger Word Detection

In this model, we will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wake word detection).


* Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
* For this model, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears us say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
* After completing this, perhaps you can also extend it to run on your laptop so that every time you say "activate" it starts up your favorite app, or turns on a network connected lamp in your house, or triggers some other event?


**Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!**
