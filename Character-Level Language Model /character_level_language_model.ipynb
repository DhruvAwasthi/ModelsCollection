Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go berserk, so choose wisely! \n",

Hopefully this algorithm will keep us and our team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath! \n",

At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end we could see dinosaur names with cool endings. Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Our model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
