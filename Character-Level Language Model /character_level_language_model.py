# # Character level language model - Dinosaurus Island
# 
# Welcome to Dinosaurus Island! 65 million years ago, dinosaurs existed, and in this model they are back. We are in charge of a special task. Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go berserk, so choose wisely!

# Luckily we have learned some deep learning and we will use it to save the day. We have collected a list of all the dinosaur names we could find, and compiled them into this [dataset](dinos.txt). To create new dinosaur names, we will build a character level language model to generate new names. Our algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep us and our team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath! 
# 
# We will begin by loading in some functions that we have in `rnn_utils`. Specifically, we have access to functions such as `rnn_forward` and `rnn_backward` which are equivalent to those we've implemented in the previous models.

# ### 1.1 - Dataset and Preprocessing
# 
# Run the following cell to read the dataset of dinosaur names, create a list of unique characters (such as a-z), and compute the dataset and vocabulary size. 

# In[2]:


data = open('dinos.txt', 'r').read()
data= data.lower()
chars = list(set(data))
data_size, vocab_size = len(data), len(chars)
print('There are %d total characters and %d unique characters in your data.' % (data_size, vocab_size))


# * `char_to_ix`: In the cell below, we create a python dictionary (i.e., a hash table) to map each character to an index from 0-26.
# * `ix_to_char`: We also create a second python dictionary that maps each index back to the corresponding character. 
#     -  This will help us figure out what index corresponds to what character in the probability distribution output of the softmax layer. 

# In[3]:


chars = sorted(chars)
print(chars)


# In[4]:


char_to_ix = { ch:i for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
ix_to_char = { i:ch for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
pp.pprint(ix_to_char)


# ### 1.2 - Overview of the model
# 
# Our model will have the following structure: 
# 
# - Initialize parameters 
# - Run the optimization loop
#     - Forward propagation to compute the loss function
#     - Backward propagation to compute the gradients with respect to the loss function
#     - Clip the gradients to avoid exploding gradients
#     - Using the gradients, update your parameters with the gradient descent update rule.
# - Return the learned parameters 
#

# <caption><center> **Figure 1**: Recurrent Neural Network, similar to what you had built in the previous notebook "Building a Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step".  </center></caption>
# 
# * At each time-step, the RNN tries to predict what is the next character given the previous characters. 
# * The dataset $\mathbf{X} = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is a list of characters in the training set.
# * $\mathbf{Y} = (y^{\langle 1 \rangle}, y^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., y^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is the same list of characters but shifted one character forward. 
# * At every time-step $t$, $y^{\langle t \rangle} = x^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$.  The prediction at time $t$ is the same as the input at time $t + 1$.

# ## 2 - Building blocks of the model
# 
# In this part, we will build two important blocks of the overall model:
# - Gradient clipping: to avoid exploding gradients
# - Sampling: a technique used to generate characters
# 
# We will then apply these two functions to build the model.

# ### 2.1 - Clipping the gradients in the optimization loop
# 
# In this section we will implement the `clip` function that we will call inside of your optimization loop. 
# 
# #### Exploding gradients
# * When gradients are very large, they're called "exploding gradients."  
# * Exploding gradients make the training process more difficult, because the updates may be so large that they "overshoot" the optimal values during back propagation.
# 
# Recall that our overall loop structure usually consists of:
# * forward pass, 
# * cost computation, 
# * backward pass, 
# * parameter update. 
# 
# Before updating the parameters, we will perform gradient clipping to make sure that your gradients are not "exploding."
# 
# #### gradient clipping
# Let's implement a function `clip` that takes in a dictionary of gradients and returns a clipped version of gradients if needed.  
# * For example, if the N=10
#     - The range is [-10, 10]
#     - If any component of the gradient vector is greater than 10, it is set to 10.
#     - If any component of the gradient vector is less than -10, it is set to -10. 
#     - If any components are between -10 and 10, they keep their original values.
#

# ### 2.2 - Sampling
# 
# Now assume that our model is trained. We would like to generate new text (characters). The process of generation is explained in the picture below:
# 
# <img src="images/dinos3.png" style="width:500;height:300px;">
# <caption><center> **Figure 3**: In this picture, we assume the model is already trained. We pass in $x^{\langle 1\rangle} = \vec{0}$ at the first time step, and have the network sample one character at a time. </center></caption>

# Let's implement the `sample` function below to sample characters. We need to carry out 4 steps:
# 
# - **Step 1**: Input the "dummy" vector of zeros $x^{\langle 1 \rangle} = \vec{0}$. 
#     - This is the default input before we've generated any characters. 
#     We also set $a^{\langle 0 \rangle} = \vec{0}$

# - **Step 2**: Run one step of forward propagation to get $a^{\langle 1 \rangle}$ and $\hat{y}^{\langle 1 \rangle}$. Here are the equations:
# 
# hidden state:  
# $$ a^{\langle t+1 \rangle} = \tanh(W_{ax}  x^{\langle t+1 \rangle } + W_{aa} a^{\langle t \rangle } + b)\tag{1}$$
# 
# activation:
# $$ z^{\langle t + 1 \rangle } = W_{ya}  a^{\langle t + 1 \rangle } + b_y \tag{2}$$
# 
# prediction:
# $$ \hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle } = softmax(z^{\langle t + 1 \rangle })\tag{3}$$

     )


# - **Step 3**: Sampling: 
#     - Now that we have $y^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$, we want to select the next letter in the dinosaur name. If we select the most probable, the model will always generate the same result given a starting letter. 
#         - To make the results more interesting, we will use np.random.choice to select a next letter that is likely, but not always the same.
#     - Sampling is the selection of a value from a group of values, where each value has a probability of being picked.  
#     - Sampling allows us to generate random sequences of values.
#     - Pick the next character's index according to the probability distribution specified by $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }$. 
#     - This means that if $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }_i = 0.16$, you will pick the index "i" with 16% probability. 
#     - This means that you will pick the index (`idx`) according to the distribution: 
# 
#     $P(index = 0) = 0.1, P(index = 1) = 0.0, P(index = 2) = 0.7, P(index = 3) = 0.2$.
# 
#     - Note that the value that's set to `p` should be set to a 1D vector.
#     - Also notice that $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$, which is `y` in the code, is a 2D array.

# - **Step 4**: Update to $x^{\langle t \rangle }$ 
#     - The last step to implement in `sample()` is to update the variable `x`, which currently stores $x^{\langle t \rangle }$, with the value of $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$. 
#     - We will represent $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$ by creating a one-hot vector corresponding to the character that we have chosen as your prediction. 
#     - We will then forward propagate $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$ in Step 1 and keep repeating the process until we get a "\n" character, indicating that we have reached the end of the dinosaur name.

# It is time to build the character-level language model for text generation. 
# 
# 
# ### 3.1 - Gradient descent 
# 
# * In this section you will implement a function performing one step of stochastic gradient descent (with clipped gradients). 
# * We will go through the training examples one at a time, so the optimization algorithm will be stochastic gradient descent. 
# 
# As a reminder, here are the steps of a common optimization loop for an RNN:
# 
# - Forward propagate through the RNN to compute the loss
# - Backward propagate through time to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters
# - Clip the gradients
# - Update the parameters using gradient descent 
# 
# Let's implement the optimization process (one step of stochastic gradient descent). 

# #### parameters
# 
# * Note that the weights and biases inside the `parameters` dictionary are being updated by the optimization, even though `parameters` is not one of the returned values of the `optimize` function. The `parameters` dictionary is passed by reference into the function, so changes to this dictionary are making changes to the `parameters` dictionary even when accessed outside of the function.

# ### 3.2 - Training the model 

# * Given the dataset of dinosaur names, we use each line of the dataset (one name) as one training example. 
# * Every 100 steps of stochastic gradient descent, you will sample 10 randomly chosen names to see how the algorithm is doing. 
# * Remember to shuffle the dataset, so that stochastic gradient descent visits the examples in random order. 
# 
# Let's implement `model()`. When `examples[index]` contains one dinosaur name (string), to create an example (X, Y), you can use this:
# 
# ##### Set the index `idx` into the list of examples
# 
# ##### Extract a single example from the list of examples
# * `single_example`: use the `idx` index that we set previously to get one word from the list of examples.

# ##### Convert a string into a list of characters: `single_example_chars`
# * `single_example_chars`: A string is a list of characters.
# * You can use a list comprehension (recommended over for-loops) to generate a list of characters.

# ##### Convert list of characters to a list of integers: `single_example_ix`
# * Create a list that contains the index numbers associated with each character.
# * Use the dictionary `char_to_ix`
# * We can combine this with the list comprehension that is used to get a list of characters from a string.

# ##### Create the list of input characters: `X`
# * `rnn_forward` uses the `None` value as a flag to set the input vector as a zero-vector.
# * Prepend the `None` value in front of the list of input characters.

# ##### Get the integer representation of the newline character `ix_newline`
# * `ix_newline`: The newline character signals the end of the dinosaur name.
#     - get the integer representation of the newline character `'\n'`.
#     - Use `char_to_ix`

# ##### Set the list of labels (integer representation of the characters): `Y`
# * The goal is to train the RNN to predict the next letter in the name, so the labels are the list of characters that are one time step ahead of the characters in the input `X`.
#     - For example, `Y[0]` contains the same value as `X[1]`  
# * The RNN should predict a newline at the last letter so add ix_newline to the end of the labels. 
#     - Append the integer representation of the newline character to the end of `Y`.

parameters = model(data, ix_to_char, char_to_ix)


# ## Conclusion
# 
# We can see that our algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of the training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end we could see dinosaur names with cool endings. Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Our model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.

# ## 4 - Writing like Shakespeare
# 
# A similar (but more complicated) task is to generate Shakespeare poems. Instead of learning from a dataset of Dinosaur names we can use a collection of Shakespearian poems. Using LSTM cells, we can learn longer term dependencies that span many characters in the text--e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character much much later in the sequence. These long term dependencies were less important with dinosaur names, since the names were quite short.

# We have implemented a Shakespeare poem generator with Keras. Run the following cell to load the required packages and models.

# In[30]:


from __future__ import print_function
from keras.callbacks import LambdaCallback
from keras.models import Model, load_model, Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Dropout, Input, Masking
from keras.layers import LSTM
from keras.utils.data_utils import get_file
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from shakespeare_utils import *
import sys
import io


# To save some time, we have already trained a model for ~1000 epochs on a collection of Shakespearian poems called [*"The Sonnets"*](shakespeare.txt). 

# Let's train the model for one more epoch. When it finishes training for an epoch---this will also take a few minutes---you can run `generate_output`, which will prompt asking you for an input (`<`40 characters). The poem will start with your sentence, and our RNN-Shakespeare will complete the rest of the poem for you! For example, try "Forsooth this maketh no sense " (don't enter the quotation marks). Depending on whether you include the space at the end, your results might also differ--try it both ways, and try other inputs as well. 
# 

# In[31]:


print_callback = LambdaCallback(on_epoch_end=on_epoch_end)

model.fit(x, y, batch_size=128, epochs=1, callbacks=[print_callback])


# In[32]:


# Run this cell to try with different inputs without having to re-train the model 
generate_output()


# The RNN-Shakespeare model is very similar to the one you have built for dinosaur names. The only major differences are:
# - LSTMs instead of the basic RNN to capture longer-range dependencies
# - The model is a deeper, stacked LSTM model (2 layer)
# - Using Keras instead of python to simplify the code
