# Emotion Detection in Images of Faces
## Best case Accuracy: 99.83% Train Accuracy and 97.33% Test Accuracy

**Understanding the problem statement**
- A nearby community health clinic is helping the local residents monitor their mental health.  
- As part of their study, they are asking volunteers to record their emotions throughout the day.
- To help the participants more easily track their emotions, we are asked to create an app that will classify their emotions based on some pictures that the volunteers will take of their facial expressions.
- As a proof-of-concept, we will first train our model to detect if someone's emotion is classified as "happy" or "not happy."

**Understanding the dataset:**
The dataset contains pictures of some volunteers in a nearby neighborhood. The dataset is labeled. It contains a total of 750 images of which we will use 600 images as train examples and 150 images as validation examples.

#### Summary:
- It is a binary classification problem
- Used `AdamOptimizer` for model optimization
- Used `binary_crossentropy` loss
##### Suggestions are always welcome!
