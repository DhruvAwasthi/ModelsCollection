# Deploy: MNIST Classifier in Realtime

In this project we will take MNIST Classifier to a little further where we will give the user a canvas board in a Browser where he/she can draw a picture representing a fashion accessory which will be classifier by our classifier in real time!


**Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!**
