# Deploy: MNIST Classifier in Realtime

In this project we will take MNIST Classifier to a little further where we will give the user a canvas board in a Browser where he/she can draw a picture representing a fashion accessory which will be classifier by our classifier in real time!

**How to reproduce?**  
- All you need to do is setup your local server, either apache or nginx and open the fashion-mnist.html file.

**Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!**
