# Convolutional Neural Networks Application on SIGNS dataset
## Best case Accuracy: 94.07% train and 78.33% test

**Understanding the dataset:**
SIGNS dataset is a collection of 6 signs representing numbers from 0 to 5. It contains a 1200 images of which we use 1080 images as train examples and 120 images as validation examples.

#### Summary:
- Implemented `forward propagation` from scratch
- Used various techniques to best fit the model such as `random mini-batches`.
- Used `AdamOptimizer` for model optimization.
